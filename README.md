# SortDesktop
 
I got really annoyed sorting my desktop every few months, so I wrote a program that does it for me. 
Kinda. It actually just makes it easier for me to sort stuff when I actually get around to it

The program was written in Visual Studio using:
1. ISO C++ Language Standard C++20 Standard
2. ISO C17 (2018) standard (for the C Standard)
This was done to use the filesystem library
